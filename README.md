# QuickMath - Math Training Game üßÆ

A fun and engaging web-based math training game with Google OAuth authentication and persistent leaderboards. The game helps users improve their mathematical skills through interactive challenges and social features.

## üîê Google OAuth Setup

To enable Google Sign-In functionality:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
